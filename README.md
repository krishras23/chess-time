# [ChessTime](https://chesstime.netlify.app)

ChessTime is a web-app that allows users to track their time spent on chess.com. By harnessing the chess.com internal API, the app reports the number of hours and minutes a user has played chess for in a given month or year. The purpose of this app is to help users become more self-aware of how much time they are spending on these websites, as they can be quite addictive.


## Tools Used
